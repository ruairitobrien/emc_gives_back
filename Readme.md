# Background
* This app is written in [ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) which is a mobile-optimized HTML5 framework built on top of [angular js](https://angularjs.org/).
* The entire application logic, templates and assets are located in the "www/" folder, so all your changes should be done there.
* `www/index.html` is the starting point of your application, but it contains mostly administrative code and markup
* `www/js` contains the application code
* `www/templates` contains the HTML templates used to render the application
* `www/css` contains the CSS styles used to assign colors, positioning to the templates


# HTML5 Learning Resources
